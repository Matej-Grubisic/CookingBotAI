**Chicken Cordon Bleu avec Mushroom Sauce (Chicken Breast stuffed with Ham and Cheese)**

This dish is a perfect representation of French cuisine, and it's achievable by any amateur cook.

Ingredients:

For the chicken breast:
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme
- Salt and pepper to taste

For the ham and cheese filling:
- 4 slices of ham (Dijon or prosciutto work well)
- 4 slices of Swiss cheese

For the mushroom sauce:
- 8 oz mixed mushrooms (button, cremini, shiitake), sliced
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. **Prepare the ham and cheese filling**: Slice the ham and Swiss cheese into thin strips.
3. Place each chicken breast on a flat surface, and make a horizontal incision in each breast to create a pocket. Be careful not to cut all the way through the breast.
4. Stuff each breast with 2-3 slices of ham and 1-2 slices of Swiss cheese.
5. In a small bowl, mix softened butter with garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper. Spread this mixture evenly on both sides of each stuffed chicken breast.
6. **Make the mushroom sauce**: In a large skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown (about 5 minutes).
7. Sprinkle flour over the mushrooms and stir for 1 minute. Gradually pour in white wine and chicken broth, whisking constantly. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it reduce by half (about 3-4 minutes). Season with salt and pepper to taste.
8. Place the stuffed chicken breasts on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, seam-side down. Drizzle the mushroom sauce over each breast.
9. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C).
10. Let the chicken rest for 5-7 minutes before slicing and serving.

Voilà! Your Chicken Cordon Bleu avec Mushroom Sauce is ready to impress your family and friends. Bon appétit!

Tips:

* Use high-quality ingredients, especially the ham and cheese.
* Make sure to seal the incision well to prevent filling from escaping during cooking.
* If you want to make it more authentic, serve with steamed vegetables or a side salad.
