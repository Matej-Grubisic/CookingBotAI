**French Onion Soup Recipe (Serves 4-6)**

Ingredients:

* 3 large onions (about 2 pounds), thinly sliced
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup dry white wine (such as Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc)
* 6 cups beef broth
* 4 slices of baguette, toasted
* 1 cup grated Gruyère cheese
* Fresh thyme leaves for garnish

Instructions:

1. **Caramelize the onions**: In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until they're dark golden brown and caramelized (about 20-25 minutes). Season with salt, pepper, and garlic.
2. **Deglaze with wine**: Pour in the white wine and bring to a simmer. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan using a wooden spoon. Cook until the liquid has almost completely evaporated (about 5 minutes).
3. **Add broth and simmer**: Add the beef broth to the saucepan, bringing it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
4. **Toast the baguette slices**: Meanwhile, slice the baguette into 1/2-inch thick rounds. Place on a baking sheet and toast in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 5-7 minutes, or until lightly browned.
5. **Assemble and top with cheese**: Ladle the hot soup into bowls and place a toasted baguette slice on top of each bowl. Sprinkle grated Gruyère cheese over the bread.
6. **Garnish with thyme and serve**: Garnish each bowl with fresh thyme leaves and a sprinkle of salt.

**Tips for beginners:**

* Use a good quality beef broth to add depth to the soup.
* Don't burn the onions; they should be dark golden brown, not black.
* If you don't have Gruyère cheese, you can use other Swiss-style cheeses like Emmental or Comté.
* To make it more authentic, serve with a side of crusty bread for dipping into the soup.

Voilà! A delicious and easy French onion soup recipe that's sure to impress. Bon appétit!
